                    12’O CUP was built from a simple passion for freshly baked pastries and well-crafted coffee. What began as a love for baking and brewing turned into a café 
                    designed to bring people together. We saw how a warm cup and a sweet treat can turn an ordinary day into something better, and we wanted to create a place 
                    where that feeling happens every day.<br><br>
                    Our mission is clear: to serve high-quality pastries and coffee in a space that feels welcoming and genuine. We are committed to using carefully selected 
                    ingredients, preparing our products fresh, and maintaining consistency in every cup and every bite. Quality is not optional for us, it’s our standard.<br><br>
                    Behind 12’O CUP is a dedicated team that shares the same goal, to create meaningful experiences for every customer. From our bakers who wake up early to 
                    prepare fresh pastries, to our baristas who carefully craft each drink, every member of our team plays a part in delivering something special.<br><br>
                    We believe connection matters. Whether you’re here to study, meet friends, celebrate small wins, or simply take a break, 12’O CUP is a space where you can feel comfortable and valued. We are not just serving food and drinks. We are building a community.

At 12’O CUP, every cup tells a story. And we’re grateful to have you as part of ours.
